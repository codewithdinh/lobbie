# Lobbie Presentation Script

## Introduction
"Hi everyone! Today I'm excited to present Lobbie, a modern discussion platform I built for sharing ideas and engaging with others. The name 'Lobbie' comes from the concept of a digital lobby where people can gather and exchange thoughts. Let me walk you through what it can do."

## Overview
"Lobbie is designed with simplicity and user experience in mind. It features a clean, intuitive interface with dark mode support and a responsive design that works across different devices."

## Feature Walkthrough

### Home Feed
"Here's the main page where you can see all posts sorted by either most recent or most upvoted. As you can see, each post displays its title, creation time, and the number of upvotes it has received. You can also search for specific posts using the search bar at the top."

### Creating Posts
"Creating content is straightforward - just click the 'Create New Post' button in the top right. You'll need to provide a title, and you have the option to add content text and an image URL. This keeps the barrier to participation low while allowing for rich content."

### Post Interaction
"When you click on a post, you're taken to its dedicated page where you can see the full content, any images, and all comments. Users can upvote posts they like, and the counter increases in real-time. You can also leave comments to start a discussion."

### Post Management
"If you've created a post, you can edit or delete it directly from its page using these buttons here. This gives users control over their content."

### Theme Customization
"Lobbie also supports theme customization - users can switch between light and dark mode depending on their preference, making the app comfortable to use at any time of day."

## Technical Highlights
"Behind the scenes, I built Lobbie using React with a component-based architecture. For data storage and retrieval, I'm using Supabase as a backend service. The app features:

- Real-time data updates for posts and comments
- Client-side routing for a smooth, SPA experience
- Context API for theme management
- Responsive design using custom CSS variables
- Loading animations when fetching data

I've also implemented sorting and filtering capabilities so users can customize how they browse content."

## Challenges & Solutions
"One challenging aspect was managing state across components while ensuring good performance. I solved this by carefully structuring my component hierarchy and using React hooks effectively.

Another challenge was creating a responsive design that works well on different screens. I tackled this using a flexible CSS approach with variables and media queries."

## Conclusion
"In summary, Lobbie is a fully functional discussion platform where users can share ideas, engage with content through upvotes and comments, and enjoy a customizable interface. I'm particularly proud of the clean user experience and responsive design.

Future enhancements could include user authentication, post categorization with tags, and the ability to upload images directly from devices. Thank you for your attention, and I'm happy to answer any questions!"
